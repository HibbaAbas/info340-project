    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
  </header>
    <p>Tracking menstrual cycles is important because each person has unique experiences with their cycle length, patterns, and flow intensity.
      Relying on online searches or experiences of others to gather information can lead to an inaccurate understanding of one’s menstrual health.
      Additionally, periods give a lot of insight into one’s overall health. Any irregularities could be an indicator that something is wrong.
      It can be difficult to tell if something is irregular or not if you don’t have proper tracking tools.
      For example, Up to 70% of women remain undiagnosed from PCOS, the leading cause of infertility and other health issues(WHO).

      However, the current options have paywalls for important health features and information.
      For example, Flo has paywalls for most key features.
      It can also be difficult to sift through information or make an analysis.
      Certain period trackers, such as MyCalendar, do not make it easy for users to find abnormalities in their cycle.
      For example, if someone is experiencing a more painful period than usual, they have no easy way of looking back at previous period logs to see if a similar event occurred in the past.
      Logs do not encourage users to log anything unusual, (prompts asking if any changes to medication, diet, etc). So even if they could find another similar log, there would most likely be no other data to give them further insight into what could be going on.

      <h2>Proposed Application:</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Users of our application will be able to have access to a range of interactive features designed to focus on tracking and enhancing users' overall experience.
      They can log their period information, track symptoms, and access health tips relevant to their menstrual cycle.
      Additionally, the platform offers the ability to filter and compare previous logs, providing valuable insights into patterns and trends over time.
      With this feature, we add another dimension to our user's understanding of their menstrual health. Another feature includes the capability to send reminders to take medication, adding another dimension to our users' health management.</p>
    <p>The app's main focus is inclusivity; we hope to empower individuals who may otherwise face barriers in accessing menstrual health resources.
      The platform emphasizes personalized insights to ensure users receive tailored support that acknowledges all diverse experiences.
      Overall, our web application serves as a solution to the problem of limited access to period tracking tools by providing an inclusive and accessible platform at no cost.</p>
